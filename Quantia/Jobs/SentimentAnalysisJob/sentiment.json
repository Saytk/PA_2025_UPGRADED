        "tldr; In a significant wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption, 18 firms collectively invested $1.22 billion in Bitcoin over five days. Strategy led the charge with a $1 billion purchase of 10,100 BTC in a single transaction. Other companies, including Metaplanet and The Blockchain Group, also made substantial investments. Additionally, 14 firms announced plans to acquire $1.16 billion worth of Bitcoin using diverse funding strategies. This trend highlights Bitcoin's growing role as a hedge against inflation and a key component of corporate financial planning.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

        "tldr; Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, hinted at another Bitcoin purchase through a cryptic post on social media, continuing his firm's aggressive acquisition strategy. MicroStrategy currently holds 592,100 BTC, valued at over $60 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Despite bullish predictions, Saylor's approach has faced criticism, particularly from investor Jim Chanos, who questioned the firm's debt structure and its potential risks. Chanos has bet against MicroStrategy while remaining optimistic about Bitcoin's future.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

        "tldr; Crypto-native asset managers have expanded their on-chain capital from $1 billion to over $4 billion since January 2025, driven by firms like Gauntlet, Steakhouse Financial, and Re7. These managers are reshaping DeFi with advanced risk management and allocation strategies, particularly in the stablecoin sector. Institutional interest in DeFi is growing, with platforms like Morpho hosting nearly $2 billion in managed capital. DeFi is evolving into a programmable financial layer, integrating compliance measures to attract institutional participation.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Now I can use the Ledger for other things.  But back to the question, is Coldcard the best hardware wallet! Hmm, it is only as good as how you use it if you expose yourself, but there is no room for \"shitcoins\""

        "I lost faith in fiat. Bitcoin is the way forward. Over the years, I've been investing consistently while sticking to my rules and learning from mistakes along the way. So far this year, I've been allocating Â£500 monthly into an All-World ETF, believing that the richer the world, the richer I get.  Additionally, I've been investing Â£500 each month into Bitcoin. Coming from a background of dabbling in forex, options, futures, altcoins, and even gambling, I've gained valuable insights over the years. One key takeaway is that Bitcoin's scarcity and deflationary nature make it an attractive long-term investment.   Consider this... Today, you might be able to buy a house for 5 bitcoins. In the future, that same house could be worth just 1 bitcoin due to Bitcoin's increasing value. Meanwhile, in fiat currency, a house priced at Â£500k today might appreciate to Â£800k, but its purchasing power may not increase significantly due to inflation.  If I make a Â£200k profit in my All-World ETF over 40 years, the real purchasing power of that gain could be much lower due to inflation. Imagine investing for 40 years and ending up with the equivalent of just Â£80k in today's money. That's not the financial future I want.  Given these insights, I've decided to shift my strategy and go all in on Bitcoin from now on. I'm in my mid-twenties, work hard, and am still living at home with my parents.  I wish y'all financial freedom.",

So my grandma had some cash she wanted to invest into a high interest bank account for me and my cousins, I convinced her to buy crypto instead as the return will be higher. Advised her to buy $20k Dot, $20k Link, $10k Trump coin. Market has obviously turned to shit and I have ignored her calls and texts recently saying she is thinking of putting the $50k into the high interest account after all. She has no clue the $50k she had is now worth about $20k. Was hoping market would bounce but I think we are cooked for a few years at least. No idea what to tell her.",
        "This has nothing to do with crypto except the fact that crypto trades 24 hours a day, even weekends and holidays.  If trad fi investors could take risk off in this geopolitical climate they would.  Trad fi traders are stuck waiting until morning.  This is what crypt traders want.  This is DeFi.  This is the freedom and thereby risk you sign up for.  There is also upside how crypto could react positively to good geo political news while trad fi markets are closed."

        "The problem with Crypto discussion is that it's primarily discussed from the perspective of the West which only incorporates a little over 1 billion people. Much of cryptos real application is in the second and third world, where finance systems are less reliable and more fragmented.   Crypto was designed to work in a system without trust. The West has a lot of trust in its financial institutions. So it's hard for people who are culturally Western to understand the value of Crypto especially as their governments try to discourage the adoption of digital assets",
        "So lets say btc becomes the world currency, like the dollar is now. Then someone sells all 5% satoshi holds......that would be like someone printing and spending 5% of the dollars m2 supply....which happens pretty much yearly at this point. If bitcoin was proven to that point of adoption the btc would just get bought, the market would recover and continue on.",
        "You could swap in any currency and the argument would still hold. Once again, we remain complacent about history and blind to even the most obvious parallels playing out in real time. Only a small fraction of people are financially literate, let alone even remotely functional. Meanwhile, the system is safeguarded by the same players who use jargon as a weapon to exclude, confuse, to extract. And then it inevitably devolves into crime being the main driver to sustain the currency.  In the long run, Bitcoin wonâ€™t survive. The banks, brokers, and the institutions will ensure *they* control whatever extractive network emerges from it. They always do. Itâ€™s the 21st-century Tower of Babel and once again, humanity plays architect to its own downfall. Every. Single. Time."
